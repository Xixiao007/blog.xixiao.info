[Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) is the next generation hypervisor technology. It has many incredible powerful features, among which its lightweight size and hosting environment independence is the main reason for me to utilize it in my personal Linux server.

As the diagram depicts below, I have set up 4 microservices using docker in one Linxu server.
0. prerequisite: [DynamicDNS using ddclient]()
1. [OpenVPN Server]()
2. [Nginx Reverse Proxy]()
3. [Personal Jekyll Blog]()
4. My own website (coming soon)
