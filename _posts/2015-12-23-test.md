I use to use Emacs key-bindings(now I use vim keys) and intended to avoid emacs users' [pinky problem](http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_pinky.html) at the first place. Thus I forced myself to rebuild muscle memory for ctrl-alt-swapping in qwert keyboard.

###What I Want:
1. In Windows system, swap both left and right sides of Ctrl and Alt keys, i.e. Press Ctrl would send Alt, press Alt would send Ctrl.
2. I do not use menu key at all, so I map menu key, which sits on the left of RAlt key in my Logitech Deluxe 250 keyboard, to RAlt in order to allow my right hand palm comfortably to hit Alt.

###Solution:
1. save the below content into a reg file, e.g. swap_keys.reg, and double click to import it.
2. log off and re-log in to take it into affect. Note. no need to reboot, log off suffices.

**Warning: you should modify this file to meet your own requirement, unless you have the same desire as I have - "1. swap both left and right sides of Ctrl and Alt keys, 2. remap menu key to RAlt key"**
