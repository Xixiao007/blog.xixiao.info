One goal of mine in year 2016 is to learn JavaScript well in order to lay solid foundation for full stack web development. I came across [FreeCodeCamp repo](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp) when I was surfing hottest repos in GitHub, and I immediately realized: *this is something for me!!*

FreeCodeCamp repo has already starred like hell -->    <a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp" data-icon="octicon-star" data-style="mega" data-count-href="/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/stargazers" data-count-api="/repos/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp#stargazers_count" data-count-aria-label="# stargazers on GitHub" aria-label="Star FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp on GitHub">Star</a>
. The number of stars truly implies how amazing freecodecamp is, and I couldn't help but jumping into it immediately.



Avoid my one-person-word, here is the quotes from FreeCodeCamp:

>Free Code Camp is an open-source community where you learn to code and help nonprofits.
>
>You start by working through our self-paced, browser-based full stack JavaScript curriculum.
>
>After you complete the first 400 hours worth of challenges (which involves building 10 single-page apps), you'll earn your Front End Development Certification.
>
>After you complete the second 400 hours worth of challenges (which involves building and deploying 5 full stack apps), you'll earn your Full Stack Development Certification.
>
>Then we'll pair you with another camper, an agile project manager, and a stakeholder from a nonprofit organization. Together, you'll plan and build an app that helps that nonprofit carry out its mission more effectively.
>
>We help our campers build job-worthy portfolios of real apps used by real people, while helping nonprofits.

Lastly, I have aimed to complete full stack certificate in year 2016, you can even track my approaching certificate progress [here](http://www.freecodecamp.com/fcc7aab8b44).
