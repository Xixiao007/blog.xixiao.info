>*"what would you wish you have learned (more) if you had chance to time travel back to day one of your programming time?"*

This is a question in Quora, One of the top voted answers is **MACHINE LEARNING**. I couldn't recall any other useful piece of information, but this is stamped in my head :).

What did I do next? I enrolled in [Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) in Coursera, and attempted to follow the series. Unfortunately, the course has fairly tight schedule and requires highly commitment to follow along each week, which making me lots of failure to return assignments in time. I would need to come back again when my agenda allows. 

If you love programming and software engineering, like I do :). I sincerely recommend that you grab at least the fundamentals of machine learning, such as by going through this 11-week free online courses, you will not regret it!

Side note. In addition to the charming machine learning knowledge, I also found out that the teacher of this course Andrew Ng launched the MOOC movement, i.e. founded Coursera, after this course's fabulous success online. What a great and brave movement!
