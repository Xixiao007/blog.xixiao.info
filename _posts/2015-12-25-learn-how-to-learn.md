### What it is and why to study it?
[Learn how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home/welcome), a course in coursera, shares me very fresh abundant ideas about how to improving the learning skills from the ground up. Despite restricted free time, I am very glad that I succeeded to set aside some time to go through this course content and completed majority of its homework.

If you are also willing to improve your learning efficiency at any topic, I highly recommend you watching the course video content either concentratedly or casually. The course does NOT contain hard-to-digest or intensive information at all, You (i.e. everybody) ought to find useful knowledge to gain better insights about `how to learn`.

Here is my study notes:

- Physical exercise is significant. It is more effective than any drug on the market today to help learn better. It benefits all of our vital organisms not just our brain.
- Create metaphor or analogy
- Chunking information
- focus mode v.s. diffuse mode
