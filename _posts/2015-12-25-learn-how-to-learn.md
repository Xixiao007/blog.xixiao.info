### Lastly, study notes for my own restudy
>I keep updating content here from each reviewing session

- Focused and Diffuse Modes:
    When learning difficult subject, the brain needs to go back and forth between the two different learning modes. That helps learn effectively.

- Chunking information

- Pomodoro tool: 25min focus and 5min reward/recess

- Study daily or space out the study sequence instead of cramming to let brain absorb more effectively. This helps to build long term memory.

- The importance of sleep in learning

- Physical exercise is significant.
    A [blog thread](http://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/well/2015/12/09/does-exercise-help-keep-our-brains-young/) in New York Times reinforced this concept. It is more effective than any drug on the market today to help learn better. It benefits all of our vital organisms not just our brain.
