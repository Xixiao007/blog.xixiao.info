I recently started learning contemporary testing knowledge.

Today I read [Killer Interview Questions](http://testingthoughts.com/blog/136) about questions in software tester interview session. It triggered me writing below content on Xmas eve.

About 2 years ago, I have decided to become a qualified software engineer, of which software testing skill is an integral part. Nowadays both `DevOps` and `infrastructure as code` hot concepts also apply to testing area.

- Luckily I am lately involved in an important project as the key tester role, which certainly speeds up my learning pace in testing area :). I will share my learned stuff in my blog once the time is ready.
- Unluckily I was also lately rejected in a software tester open position without even entering the first round interview session. The main reason, which I can speculate only, is my lack of software testing experience. I am absolutely not aghast for the rejection, but somehow sad about being unable to show my recent learned CI (continuous integration) testing skills in a interview session.

If you are also intrigued about software testing and are fond of listening to podcast, I highly recommend that you subscribe to [TestTalks](http://joecolantonio.com/testtalks/).
